## Bias from prior knowledge

The first question alone is highly debated in the wider field of ML.
The frequently quoted “Bitter Lesson” posits that we should refrain from inducing all but the most basic biases in our models, and that we should not view metrics as the ultimate measure of performance, but rather whether the model gets us closer to some truth [@{http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html}].
However, it has been argued that many improvements that led to the models of today, such as convolution or attention, disprove this theory [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762], and that the intrinsic complexity of real-world systems does not obviate, but rather necessitate, the integration of human insight into our learning frameworks [@{https://rodneybrooks.com/a-better-lesson/}; @{https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1106534178676506624.html}].

In systems biology, specifically, there is much interest in finding models with suitable biases to deal with constraints specific to the field, such as data availability and the completeness of prior knowledge [@doi:10.48550/arxiv.1811.12359;@doi:10.1109/JPROC.2021.3058954;@doi:10.48550/arxiv.2106.12430;@doi:10.1098/rspa.2021.0068;@doi:10.48550/arXiv.2312.00818;@doi:10.1098/rspa.2021.0068;@doi:10.48550/arXiv.2312.00818].
Considering these constraints, the question is not whether to include prior knowledge in our reasoning, but which knowledge, when, and how [@{https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1106534178676506624.html}].

### Prior knowledge

To be able to effectively use our knowledge in reasoning, we must be able to represent it robustly and in a way that is conducive to the reasoning task.
Biomedical entities and relationships must be clearly defined and represented unambiguously.
Additionally, the diversity in our tasks and knowledge sources requires a flexible representation that can be adapted to the task at hand.
Knowledge representation frameworks can aid in walking the line between robust and transparent, reproducible knowledge representation on the one hand, and flexible, task-specific workflows on the other [@doi:10.1038/s41587-023-01848-y].
In addition, they can ground the biological entities that are subject to reasoning using domain-specific ontologies, which can be another useful source of bias.
For instance, knowing the directionality of the central dogma of biology can be a useful bias in reasoning about gene expression.
