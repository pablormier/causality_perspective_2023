## Bias from prior knowledge

### Prior knowledge

The human mind will be the gold standard for reasoning for the foreseeable future.
However, human reasoning is limited by our sensory and mnemonic capacity; we cannot reason about high-dimensional data since we can neither perceive nor keep in memory thousands of agents at the same time.
Hence, to make the most of our immense wealth of data, we must elevate our algorithms’ reasoning capabilities.
A sensible approach is to look to our reference model, the human, to try and transfer some of our capabilities to the in silico reasoner.
In particular, to be successful in developing algorithms which we can trust to reason in the high-dimensional space of molecular biomedicine, they must use the available prior knowledge effectively.
This can most likely be achieved through converting the prior knowledge into suitable inductive biases [@doi:10.48550/arxiv.1811.12359; @doi:10.1109/JPROC.2021.3058954; @doi:10.48550/arxiv.2106.12430].

In combining prior knowledge with reasoning algorithms, we need to remain mindful that the aim is not just to increase performance based on some metric, which is known as the „bitter lesson“ [@{http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html}].
It has been argued that the intrinsic complexity of real-world systems does not obviate, but rather necessitate the integration of human insight into our learning frameworks [@{https://rodneybrooks.com/a-better-lesson/}; @{https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1106534178676506624.html}].
The impressive performance of recent deep learning models is only made possible by the introduction of attention or convolution as architectural inductive biases [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762].
Considering the shortcomings of prior knowledge on biomedical molecular interactions as well as the constraints on available data, the question is not whether to include prior knowledge in our reasoning, but which knowledge, when, and how [@{https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1106534178676506624.html}].
