## Bias from prior knowledge

The first question alone is highly debated in the wider field of ML.
The frequently quoted “Bitter Lesson” posits that we should refrain from inducing all but the most basic biases in our models, and that we should not view metrics as the ultimate measure of performance, but rather whether the model gets us closer to some truth [@{http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html}].
However, it has been argued that many improvements that led to the models of today, such as convolution or attention, disprove this theory [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762], and that the intrinsic complexity of real-world systems does not obviate, but rather necessitate, the integration of human insight into our learning frameworks [@{https://rodneybrooks.com/a-better-lesson/}; @{https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1106534178676506624.html}].

In systems biology, specifically, there is much interest in finding models with suitable biases to deal with constraints specific to the field, such as data availability and the completeness of prior knowledge [@doi:10.48550/arxiv.1811.12359;@doi:10.1109/JPROC.2021.3058954;@doi:10.48550/arxiv.2106.12430;@doi:10.1098/rspa.2021.0068;@doi:10.48550/arXiv.2312.00818;@doi:10.1098/rspa.2021.0068].
Considering these constraints, the question is not whether to include prior knowledge in our reasoning, but which knowledge, when, and how [@{https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1106534178676506624.html}].

### Prior knowledge

Prior knowledge refers to information or data that is available to inform a learning process, enhancing the performance of the trained models and their ability to generalise. It can be used to inform the inductive biases of a model, either explicitly through the design choices and assumptions embedded into the models, or implicitly through the data and methods used in training. For this to be possible, biomedical entities and relationships must be clearly defined and represented unambiguously. Additionally, the diversity in our tasks and knowledge sources requires a flexible representation. Knowledge representation frameworks can aid in this process [@doi:10.1038/s41587-023-01848-y].

In the biomedical field, there is a rich tradition of documenting biological knowledge at various levels of detail and focusing on different aspects of biology. Detailed mechanistic models, provide mathematical descriptions of the dynamic interactions at a molecular or cellular level. Genome-scale networks, including metabolic and gene regulatory networks, offer comprehensive views of metabolic processes and gene interactions [@doi:10.1038/nrg3885]. Protein-protein interaction databases recapitulate either causal or non-causal interactions between proteins [@doi:10.1038/nrg3885]. These examples of prior knowledge, from complex mechanistic mathematical descriptions of dynamical systems to undirected networks of interconnected proteins, provide useful sources of information that can be leveraged to inform models.
